I have been meaning to compile these maps for a while, so here is a compilation of my maps for the [#30DayMapChallenge](https://github.com/tjukanovt/30DayMapChallenge) (years 2021 and 2022).

# 2021

## Day 5 - OpenStreetMap

## Day 11 - 3D

![Elevation Ridgline Plot of Montserrat, Spain](day11-2021.jpg)

Made in Blender. It's 3D, I promise.

## Day 17 - Land

## Day 19 - Island(s)

Thanks to John Nelson for his [tutorial](https://youtu.be/J0PWED9Orr4).

## Day 21 - Elevation

![Another view of Montserrat in Spain](day21-elevation.jpg)

Played around with a more densified joy plot and controlling the emission by z-value.

# 2022

## Day 9 - Space

![Tears in the Urban Fabric: Parking Lots in Downtown Grand Rapids](day9-2022.jpg)

My urban planning professor in college called them tears in the urban fabric, so I'm showing them as voids in the felt style made by John Nelson.

## Day 14 - Hexagons

![Muppet Place Names in the Contentinal US](day14-2022.jpg)
All "Muppet" place names in the continental US (e.g. Kermit, Gonzo, Animal, Janice, Pepe, Ms. Piggy, Rizzo, Scooter, Statler & Waldorf)
