## Overview
The Varieties of Democracy (V-Dem) is an attempt to measure and conceptualize democracy throughout the world. With a global team of over 50 social scientists, they put forth five high-level indicators of democracy (scale 0-1, low-high): 


- Electoral: Are rulers responsive to citizens? Is there electoral competition?
- Liberal: Are individual & minority rights protected? Are limits placed on the government?
- Participatory: To what extent do citizens participate in political processes?
- Deliberative: Are political descisions motivated by the public good?
- Egalitatrian: Do inequities hurt the ability of citizens from participating in government?

## Tech stack
Data was prepared in Python. Most of the vizualition is done with Leaflet, but if you choose to view country-level data by population (under the advanced menu), then the application utilizes d3.
