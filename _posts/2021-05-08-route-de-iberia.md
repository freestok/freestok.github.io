For those curious, data prep was done with ArcGIS Pro/GDAL, shaded relief in Blender, overlay of simplified land use and water done in Photoshop, and labeling finalized in Illustrator.

Also yes, I wish I had included elevation of S. France, N. Africa, and the Balearic Islands, but I had originally clipped to the DEM to Portugal and Spain (so, a majority of the peninsula, but excluding S. France).
